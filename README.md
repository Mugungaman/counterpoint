# counterpoint

A complex and intricate Java algorithm that generates one or two part classical counterpoint melodies (following the rules set forth by the 17th century composer Johann Joseph Fux). I used Object Oriented Programming to abstract out mechanisms involved in the composition of a melody, and bottom up recursion to compose melodies. The finalized melodies are both written to MIDI files and stored in a MySQL database. API coming soon!
